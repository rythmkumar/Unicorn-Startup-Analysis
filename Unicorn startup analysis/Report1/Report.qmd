## About the Data

We scraped the data about the Unicorn Startups in the World from [CB Insights](https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies) and Wikipedia which has collected data from IMF's World economic outlook and World Bank's Data.

The variables extracted are as follows:

-   **Company**
    -   *character*
    -   Startup's name
-   **Valuation**
    -   *integer*
    -   Companies' Valuation

    -   Unicorn joining *Date*
-   **Country**
    -   *character*
    -   Country of origin
-   **City**
    -   *character*
    -   City of origin
-   **Industry**
    -   *character*
    -   Type of industry. This has been sub-classified into -Media & Entertainment -Industrials -Consumer & Retail -Financial Services -Enterprise Tech -Healthcare & Life Sciences -Insurance
-   **Select Investors**
    -   *Character*
    -   Investors' Name The data consists of Unicorn Startups across different countries in decreasing order of their Valuation.

The data consists of 1050 data points with 7 variables.
This data consists of
We also have additional variables for every country for 2021:

-   Population
-   GDP
-   Population Density
-   GDP Growth Rate

## Obtaining the Data

The data was obtained from the following sources:

-   Main Data Scraped from CB Insights:
[Link](https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies)
-   Added data of GDP from Wikipedia
[Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)#References)

## Biases in the Data
- **Biases in Methodology** Our data collection methodology involves scraping information from CB Insights. It's important to note that the status of unicorn companies, defined as those with a valuation exceeding $1 billion, can be dynamic. Companies may transition out of unicorn status due to factors such as going public or experiencing a decrease in valuation. This fluidity introduces potential biases into our dataset. As the unicorn landscape evolves over time, periodic updates and considerations for these status changes are essential. Acknowledging these methodological nuances is crucial for a nuanced interpretation of the data, as it reflects the dynamic nature of the startup ecosystem.

## Industry Analysis

```{r message = FALSE}
#| echo: false
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
load("./../Startup.Rdata")
Combined_data %>% ggplot(aes(y = Industry))+
  geom_bar(colour = 'red', fill = 'pink')+
  labs(x = "Number of Unicorns", y = "Industries", title = "NUMBER OF UNICORNS IN EACH INDUSTRY")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 14),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 14),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 18, colour = "brown"),
        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 16, colour = 'blue'),  # Adjust x-axis label size
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 16, colour = 'blue'))

```

In this plot we can see that the most number of unicorns in the world are in the Enterprise Tech Industry.

![](Industry_year.png)

Here we can clearly see that most Unicorns were in the Consumer & Retail before 2020. However post-COVID the number of unicorns in the Enterprise Tech rise. We have seen a shift of Industry as the silicon valley and many other tech hubs in the world have become popular. The growth of the other industries has been uniform.

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| echo: false
ggplot(Combined_data, aes(x = Industry, y = Valuation...B.)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = c("lightblue","green","Red","pink","orange","grey","yellow"), color = "black",outlier.shape = NA) +
  labs(x = "Industry", y = "Valuation", title = "Boxplot of Valuation by Industry") +
  theme_bw()+ ylim(c(0,7.5))

```

```{r}
#| echo: false
table = Combined_data %>% group_by(Industry) %>% summarise(Avg = mean(Valuation...B.), median = median(Valuation...B.))
print(table)
```

The mean and median valuation of Various industries are shown in billions.

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(ggExtra)
data = Found_year
hyphen_indices <- which(data$Equity.Funding.Raised...M. == "-")
values <- data$Equity.Funding.Raised...M.[data$Equity.Funding.Raised...M. != "-"]
x = as.numeric(values)
y = data$Valuation...B.[-hyphen_indices]

x = c(x, rep(0,10))
y = c(y, rep(0,10))


data = data %>% mutate(Equity = x)
data = data %>% mutate(Valuation = y)

g =   data %>% ggplot(aes(y = Valuation, x = Equity))+
      geom_jitter(aes(colour = Company.Stage))+
      coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,3000),ylim = c(0,15))+
      theme_minimal()+ 
      labs("Valuation vs Equity raised", x = "Equity Raised in M", y = "Valuation in B")
    
ggMarginal(g, type = "violin", fill = "transparent")
```

According to the plot, most unicorns have raised a Equity of around 500 million and have a valuation of 2.5 billion dollars. Here the colours represent the stages (The "series of funding" refers to the various stages or rounds of investment that a startup or a company goes through to raise capital from external sources)

1.  **Seed Funding**:

    -   Seed: Funding used to validate the product, develop a business model, and potentially start early-stage production.

2.  **Series A, B, C, and Beyond**:

    -   Series A: Follows the seed round and is used to scale the business, expand operations, and further develop products or services.

    -   Series B, C, and subsequent rounds: Successive funding rounds that continue to support the company's growth, market expansion, acquisitions, or preparing for an IPO (Initial Public Offering).

3.  **Late-Stage Rounds**:

    -   IPO: The initial sale of a company's stock to the public market.

4.  **Acquired:**

    -   When the company is bought out by a bigger company.

## Growth rate and it's impact on Unicorns.

```{r}
#| echo: false
saal = rep(2013:2022,8)
Growth_rate$year = saal
Growth_rate %>% ggplot(aes(x = year, colour = group))+
  geom_line(aes(y = Growth_rate))+
  geom_line(aes(y = Annual_change), linetype = "dotted")+
  labs(title = "Growth rate vs years for each country", caption = "Dotted lines represent annual change", x = "Years", y = "Growth rate")
```

```{r}
#| echo: false


length(Combined_data$Company)  
x = character(length = 1048)
for(i in 1:1048){
  x[i] = strsplit(Combined_data$Date.Joined, "/")[[i]][3]
}

x = as.numeric(x)
Combined_data = Combined_data %>% mutate(Year_joined = x)
Combined_data %>% ggplot(aes(x = Year_joined))+
  geom_bar() + theme_bw() + labs(title = "Number of unicorns joined per year", x = "Years", y = "Number of unicorns")

```

The Growth rate pre-COVID has been fairly even for all countries and doesn't impact the number of unicorns to a great extent. However it is very counter-intuitive to see that we then growth rate for all countries was negative we have the most number of unicorns being formed. One expects that when the country's economy is down it is bad for business but the data shows otherwise.

## Month-wise Analysis

![](month_unicorn.png)

Most Unicorns form in the second-fiscal (April, May, June). Also most of them form in the starting of the fiscal quarter (January, April, October) in the third fiscal quarter the distribution is fairly even.

The fiscal quarter is a three month period. At the end of each quarter every company files a quarterly report with the government's financial institution. This report helps the investors to make decision about their investments.

This is a possible explanation of the trend observed.

## Analysis of Indian Unicorns

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
main_plot = India %>% ggplot(aes(x = Years.To.Unicorn, y = Valuation..In...Bn.))+
  geom_jitter(aes(colour = Current.Status), size = 2)+
  labs(y = "Valuation of Billions", x = "Years to Unicorn")

ggMarginal(main_plot, type = "histogram", fill = "blue")

```

Most Unicorns in India are Private and most start-ups take 5-6 years to become a Unicorn.

```{r}
#| echo: false

India %>% ggplot(aes(x = "", fill = Sector))+geom_bar()+coord_polar(theta = "y")+theme_minimal()+labs(title = 'Industries', x = "Number of Unicorns")
```

Most Unicorns in India belong to the Consumer Service, Enterprise-tech and Fin-tech.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
vec = gsub(",", "", India$Total.Funding..in...)
vec = as.numeric(vec)

India$Total.Funding..in... = vec

India %>% ggplot(aes(x = Valuation..In...Bn., y = Total.Funding..in...))+
  geom_point(aes(colour = Headquarters, alpha = 0.5))+labs(title = "Valuation vs Funding", x = "Valution in billions", y = "Total Funding")+
  theme_bw()+xlim(c(0,12))+ylim(c(0,5.5e+09))
```

The Unicorns with highest Valuation come from Bengaluru and the most funding was raised from Delhi NCR.

```{r}
#| echo: false
f_industries  = strsplit(Feamle_startups$Industries, ",")
f_industries = unlist(f_industries)
f_industries = as_tibble(table(f_industries))
female_data = f_industries %>% filter(n > 3)

ggplot(female_data, aes(x = "", y = n, fill = f_industries)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_polar(theta = "y") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Industry Distribution")
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
valuation = character(length = 125)
for(i in 1:125){
  valuation[i] = strsplit(Feamle_startups$Valuation, " ")[[i]][2]
}
valuation = valuation[2:125]
valuation = substring(valuation,2,5)
valuation = as.numeric(valuation)
median(valuation)
boxplot(valuation, col = "cyan", horizontal = TRUE,xlabs = "Valuation in Billions", main = "Valuation of Startups with females leaders", sub = "Avg: 2.89, Median: 1.5")
```

```         
```

![The above plot shows us that the countries with most female contribution to unicorns is Vietnam and Lithuania. Countries like India and US although have a lot of Unicorn start-ups, have low share of female founder/co-founder.](Female_distribution.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
